# Simple experiments with LoRa and LoRaWAN

This repository is intended to collect a number of simple implementations with different nodes that support LoRa or LoRaWAN.

## LoRa

### TTGO-LoRa32-SendReceiver 

From https://github.com/cubapp/LilyGO-TTGO-LoRa32-SenderReceiver, included in https://github.com/jorgenavarroortiz/lora-lorawan-simple-experiments/tree/main/LoRa/TTGO-LoRa32-SenderReceiver. It simply sends a counter and a random number from a LoRa sender to a LoRa receiver, and show the information in the display.

### Sending images over LoRa

TO BE WRITEN, using Pycom nodes.

## LoRaWAN

### The Things Uno

The [LoRaWAN/TheThingsUno/TTNUnoSendABP](https://github.com/jorgenavarroortiz/lora-lorawan-simple-experiments/tree/main/LoRaWAN/TheThingsUno/TTNUnoSendABP) directory contains a sample code that sends information in CayenneLPP (Low Power Payload) format. It includes the code for a flame sensor detector KY-026.
